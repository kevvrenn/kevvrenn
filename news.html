                <h2>Kageyama</h2>
                <p>
                    Tobio Kageyama is the deuteragonist of the ""Haikyuu!!" series. For the majority of the series, 
                    he is a first-year student at Karasuno High School 
                    and plays as the starting setter for the boys' volleyball club.
                    He was chosen to train at the All-Japan youth training camp during his first year of high school and joined the V. 
                    League as soon as he graduated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kageyama's height and impressively sharp glare are said to be his most prominent physical features and source of attraction to several female classmates. 
                    He is of a lean but muscular build. He often emits an intimidating aura, 
                    which is heightened by the almost permanent scowl on his face. His black hair is cropped short, 
                    with a fringe that hangs just above his dark blue eyes. 
                    His typical attire consists of either his school uniform or practice clothes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perpetually sullen, arrogant, and undeniably short-tempered, Kageyama originally came off as a typical overbearing perfectionist, 
                    caring only about winning and completely disregarding the opinions and well-being of his teammates. 
                    His habit of complaining about their performance and barking orders at them eventually led the other players in Kitagawa Daiichi to nickname him the "King of the Court", 
                    a constant reminder of the oppressive, 
                    egocentric attitude he demonstrated during his volleyball career in junior high.
                </p>
            <br> <br> 
                <h2>Sugawara</h2>
                <p>
                    Koshi Sugawara was a third-year student at Karasuno High. He was the vice-captain, a substitute setter and pinch server for the boys' volleyball team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sugawara is shown to be average in height with a slender build. 
                    He has slightly thick eyebrows, light grey hair, and hazel-brown eyes with a birthmark mole under his left eye. 
                    He is usually seen with a gentle smile on his face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being the vice-captain, he has a soothing and gentle personality for his teammates and acts as a pillar of support for them. 
                    Even though he isn't Karasuno's regular setter anymore, he does not dream of giving up on playing. 
                    As such, he encourages himself and all of his teammates to never give up, no matter how rough the situation might be.
                </p>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Nishinoya</h2>
                <p>
                    Yu Nishinoya was a second-year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He was the libero for the boys' volleyball team and was referred to as "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" by his teammates, for his remarkable skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nishinoya is the shortest member of the team, standing at 159.3 cm. 
                    Despite his shorter stature, he has a fairly muscular build. 
                    He regularly styles his wild black hair by ruffling most of it upwards, adding 10 cm to his height; 
                    the tiny tuft of hair that falls over his forehead appears to be bleached a dirty blond. His eyes are brown and slanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nishinoya is a very energetic and temperamental person. 
                    His boisterous nature and crazy shenanigans can attract unwanted attention quite easily, which often goes badly for him. 
                    Although he hardly ever worries about the consequences of his actions (and may even revert to violence to vent out his anger on certain occasions), 
                    he is surprisingly considerate of his friends' feelings and insecurities.
                </p>
                <br><br><br><br>><br>
                <h2>Tsukishima</h2>
                <p>
                    Kei Tsukishima is a first year at Karasuno High. He plays as one of the starting middle blockers on the boys volleyball team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tsukishima is very tall and has an incredibly slim build for a volleyball player. 
                    Despite being a first-year, he is the tallest player on the volleyball team; standing at 190.1 cm. 
                    He has short blond hair, pale skin, thin eyebrows, and golden-brown eyes. 
                    He is often seen with a frown or a condescending smirk on his face.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tsukishima is very blunt and will sometimes rile his teammates up due to his antagonistic nature (most notably being Hinata, Kageyama, Nishinoya, and Tanaka) 
                    and sometimes other teams because of his casual smug attitude, taking pride in and relishing when his opponents see him as a nuisance as seen with Tendō and Shirabu.
                    Whenever someone does or says something stupid or silly he is usually seen snickering in the background. 
                    However, he does seem to be intimidated by his seniors, 
                    being nowhere in sight when Daichi reprimands Tanaka for antagonizing Aoba Johsai even though he did so as well, 
                    or backing down whenever Ennoshita calls him out.
                </p>
                <br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Sawamura</h2>
                <p>
                    Daichi Sawamura was a third-year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He was the captain and a starting wing spiker for the boys' volleyball team. 
                    During the period when the original coach, Ikkei Ukai, was hospitalized, 
                    he was one of the captains who had to act as the team's coach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daichi has short dark hair and dark brown eyes. He is not particularly tall among volleyball players and possesses a muscular build. 
                    It's been noted by many players that he seems "big" up close, to which most of the time Daichi believes he is being called fat. 
                    Daichi has a reassuring appearance that immediately gives off the aura of a captain and mature individual. He is usually seen with a gentle smile on his face, 
                    but when he gets angry, his eyes glaze over intimidatingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daichi is a very caring and responsible captain who always puts his team first. 
                    He is also very patient and understanding, but becomes terrifying when angry, though he only shows this side when necessary. 
                    He becomes very strict when his teammates are out of line, as shown when he locked out Kageyama and Hinata from the gym when they argued and refused to listen. 
                    Nevertheless, his actions have always been for the best interest of the team. 
                    Due to his devotion to his team and his command, he is both well-respected and feared by his team.
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h2>Azamune</h2>
                <p>
                    Asahi Azumane was a third-year student at Karasuno High. He was a wing spiker and its ace for the boys' volleyball club.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has long hair which is usually styled as a bun behind his head and dark brown eyes matching his hair as well as his eyebrows. 
                    He also appears to be growing a short scruff on his chin. 
                    His overall appearance makes him look older than he is which causes others to be afraid to approach him because of his intimidating appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to his appearance, Asahi is rather quiet and gentle and has difficulties accepting that he is Karasuno's ace, 
                    as he initially doesn't see himself as the ace. Asahi is said to have a "Glass Heart", taking everything that is said about him to heart, 
                    and becoming depressed because of it at times. He shows to be weak-willed at the beginning when he leaves the team 
                    before the first-years joined the team as he felt that he let down his entire team when they lost against Date Tech even though the team thought otherwise.
                </p>
                <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>Tanaka</h2>
                <p>
                    Ryunosuke Tanaka for the majority of the series is a second year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He is part of the boys volleyball club and plays as a starting wing spiker. 
                    Tanaka was known as the teams up-and-coming ace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tanaka has a shaved head with a widow's peak and sharp blue-grey eyes (golden brown in the manga colored illustrations) which led many to mistake him as a delinquent. 
                    Back in his first year at Karasuno, Tanaka had short fuzzy hair dyed in a light color (blond in the anime). He is average in height and has a lean, but strong build. 
                    He tends to make intimidating faces to try to scare others, which Daichi scolds him for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loud, hot-headed, and easily angered, he is no stranger to picking fights. He is also somewhat of a slacker, 
                    shown by his less-than-stellar work ethic in school and his usual lateness to practices. 
                    Despite all this, he is shown to be caring and supportive of his teammates, and even protective of his underclassmen. 
                    Tanaka doesn't take kindly to people who belittle others, as shown when he grows upset at Kei Tsukishima for trash-talking others during their first 3-on-3 match. 
                    In addition, he gets very excited and is easily won over when an underclassman calls him "senpai".
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <h2>Yamaguchi</h2>
                <p>
                    Tadashi Yamaguchi is a first year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He plays on the boys volleyball team as a middle blocker and pinch server. 
                    During his third year, he became the team captain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He has dark grayish-green hair with a flyaway piece of hair sticking up at the top. He has large eyes with small, amber colored pupils. 
                    Yamaguchi is taller than average and has a thin build. This, coupled with his freckles, 
                    had caused him to be bullied when he was younger; although he doesn't seem to be bothered by this anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yamaguchi is a pretty shy person who relies on others early on; most likely stemmed from being bullied because of his appearance. Despite this, 
                    Yamaguchi is generally a nice person but does tend to join Tsukishima in teasing others; mainly Kageyama and Hinata. 
                    He does show that he is a loyal friend and a supportive teammate. 
                    Yamaguchi can at times be seen defending Tsukishima from things he believes were insults toward his friend.

                <p>

                <p>
                    Like Tanaka, he has a shaved head except his hair appears much darker and doesn't have a widow's peak. He is tall and has a lean build. 
                    He has wide brown eyes and narrow eyebrows that match his hair color.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Narita appears to be a calm, friendly person who doesn't get riled up too easily. 
                    He also appears to enjoy occasionally teasing Tanaka or his other teammates.

                <h2>Kinoshita</h2>
                <p>
                    Hisashi Kinoshita is a second-year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He plays as one of the boys' volleyball team's substitute wing spikers and pinch servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kinoshita has short, spiky light brown hair and large narrowed eyes. 
                    He is average in height and is the shortest second-year apart from Nishinoya.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kinoshita is a kind although somewhat shy individual. 
                    He gets along relatively well with his team and is not afraid to occasionally poke fun at them; 
                    such as mocking Tanaka for stripping off his shirt during the first-years match.

                <h2>Ennoshita</h2>
                <p>
                    Chikara Ennoshita was a second-year student at Karasuno High. 
                    He played as a substitute wing spiker for the boys' volleyball team. In his third year, he became the team captain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ennoshita is an average-looking guy with slightly down-turned eyes, causing him to have a somewhat sleepy look on his face. 
                    He has medium-length dark brown hair kept parted near the middle. His eyebrows and eyes are the same brown color. 
                    He doesn't usually attract much attention and often goes unmentioned even when he's on court.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He's usually quiet, reserved and can sometimes be seen with a gentle smile on his face, but he can also behave boldly towards the other second-years. 
                    Ennoshita is the only second-year who's able to control Tanaka and Nishinoya. 
                    He has the ability to understand and relate to different people and has been noted to be a stabilizing presence for the underclassmen; this trait makes him a good candidate to be a captain. Despite this, Ennoshita lacks confidence in himself, mostly because of his lack of experience in matches, and initially had trouble while subbing in for Daichi in the match against Wakutani Minami. 
                    Ennoshita's also smart and has never received a failing mark before.
